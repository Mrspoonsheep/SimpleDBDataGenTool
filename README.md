# SimpleDBDataGenTool
a simple, although in its current state, quite scuffed tool used to generate arbitrary amounts of test data for databases. Written because it seems that this kind of tool is very hard to come by for no real reason, hence this is free and will always remain free. The code is relatively extensively commented to make it easier to follow. Written in C#

# BEWARE
*As of right now, this tool requires you to go into the source code and edit it to be usable for an individual usecase, I may or may not update this to be more generalized and robust as well as faster in the future.*
